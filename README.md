# Polearms
A mod for Minecraft that adds Spears; Basically, swords with longer reach.

I will upload the code soon, but I want to get it working in IntelliJ first.
This is currently for MC1.7.10, and I want to work on getting it operational in MC1.10.2. I'm not sure whether I'll put the 1.10.2 version in a new repo, or a directory in here...
The 1.7.10 version is compiled against Forge 1614.
The 1.10.2 version is not yet started.

You can download the mod on Curse here: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/polearms

I coded this up in about 2014(I don't remember exactly when), basing it off of BedrockMiner's very good tutorials(now discontinued, but still available here:https://bedrockminer.jimdo.com/).
I didn't release it then, as I was not at all confident that it would be any good. I thought it was a decent idea, and I didn't know of any other mod that did this.
I also should say that I cannot guarantee that I will continue this project. I am a uni student, and that will eat a good deal of my time. By all means drop in bug reports, but don't expect a timely response.
That's part of the motivation for putting it up here, and for the use of the Apache license. Derivatives are welcome, but I would prefer it if you kept the same license.

Suggestions are welcome, but this is meant to be a fairly focussed mod. If it isn't an extended-reach item, it should probably go in a different mod.
Something less nice: I reserve the right to decide whether or not to implement suggestions. If I don't want to, for whatever reason, I won't do it. (Robocraft works like that, but they didn't tell anyone, and it led to a lot of nasty surprises. I intend to learn from their bad example.)
However, unlike Robocraft, if you really want to, you can fork my code, and add it yourself!
